# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This weather dashboard was built to retrieve data from the OpenWeather API to display weather forecasts for the current day as well as a 5-day forecast. It runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS and uses local storage to store any persistent data.

The following video demonstrates the functionality of the application:
